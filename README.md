## Overview

This project is an [Express](https://expressjs.com) server that posts the same locally-stored picture of Pixel [Mike Wazowski](https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Mike_Wazowski) to the [@dailypixelmike](https://www.instagram.com/dailypixelmike/) Instagram page every day at 12 PM Eastern Time via [node-cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) and [instagram-web-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/instagram-web-api). The image is in JPG format since that is Instagram's default format for images. Any other image format will be converted to JPG by Instagram and hence lose some of its quality in the conversion process.

Every post includes a custom caption that includes Pixel Mike's "feeling" of the day. This "feeling" is a random adjective or adverb generated by [wordpos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wordpos), which pulls lexicographic data from [WordNet online](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn). Each caption also includes a definition for the adjective or adverb, which is also provided by [wordpos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wordpos) and parsed to make a complete sentence. Additional hashtags are also included in an automated comment by [@dailypixelmike](https://www.instagram.com/dailypixelmike/) on each of [@dailypixelmike](https://www.instagram.com/dailypixelmike/)'s daily Instagram posts.

The server initially logs in to Instagram with a username and password. It then persists the authenticated cookies in a cookie store via [tough-cookie-filestore2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie-filestore2) for future use. The server is deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and the Heroku dyno kept awake with [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/).

I have also created a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E46vCLlJ2Dw) for this project. It includes configuring Heroku, setting up an Instagram client, and configuring a cookie store.
